            <strong>A New Report Shows</strong>
        </p>
        <p>In the rapidly warming Antarctic, two species of penguins are in dramatic decline.</p>
        <p>That’s the news out of a new study published by Oceanites, a nonprofit organization that closely monitors penguins
            and other <span>Antarctic seabirds</span>, in collaboration with researchers from NASA and
            Stony Brook University in New York.</p>
        <p>Relying on satellite photos and on-the-ground analysis from more than 660 sites across the frozen continent, the
            study paints a broad picture of the health of several Antarctic penguin species: the Adélie, chinstrap, emperor,
            and gentoo. Like endangered <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-plan-on-threatened-polar-bears-lacks-teeth-critics-say/"

            </a>.</p>
        <p>The report looked specifically at the Antarctic Peninsula, which has warmed by a year-round average of 5 degrees
            Fahrenheit in the past 60 years. There, two species — Adélie and chinstrap penguins — were reported to be in
            severe decline. Meanwhile, gentoo penguins appeared to be adapting to changing circumstances. </p>
